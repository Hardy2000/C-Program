# C-Program
Some Algorithm Using C/C++

# MAXMIN
Finding Maximun and Minimum element in an array.(Sorted or Unsorted)

# MergeSort
Selection Sort Algorithm in an array.

# 0/1 Knapsack
This code solves 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming.

# Fractional Knapsack
This code solves above algorithm using greedy approach.

# BINARYSE
Simple Binary Search in an array.

# Kruskal Algorithm
Kruskal Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph using greedy approach.

# prims2
Prim's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph using greedy approach.

# QUICKSORT
Selection Sort Algorithm in an array.

# SelectionSort
Selection Sort Algorithm in an array.

# StudentRecord
This code shows use of file handling in C++. In this program user can create, modify, delete student record. User interface is modified using interactive functions such as delay() and color(). It can be run using Turbo C++ Compiler.

# Emp_Details
This code shows use of file handling in C++. In this program user can create, modify, delete employee record. It can be run using Turbo C++ Compiler.

# Note:
You may face problem while running these program.
Some programs are run using visual studio code which uses Gcc compiler where as some run in Turbo c++. First see the codes of the program is header file is #include<iostream.h> then run it in Turbo C++ else run in visual studio code which uses Gcc compiler.
